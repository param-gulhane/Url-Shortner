The objective is to design and implement a scalable Custom URL Shortener API that includes advanced analytics, and rate limiting. This system will allow users to create short URLs that simplify the sharing of long, complex URLs across various platforms, making it easier for users to distribute links in a concise format.

It requires the implementation of unique features such as grouping links under specific topics (e.g., acquisition, activation, retention) and providing detailed analytics for both individual and overall URLs.

This is coded in Node.js, Express.js using MongoDB as database and mongoose to communicate with database.
